bin1=subset(t0, t0<.4)#defines bin1 (recruit class)
t0<-subset(t0, t0>.4) #re-defines t0 to exclude recruit class


brks=hist(c(t0))#This uses the hist function to create the bins. Simple. Problem=equal sized bins.

##Below is an alternative. 
#This code defines breaks with the specific recruit class, then by quantiles and the median.
